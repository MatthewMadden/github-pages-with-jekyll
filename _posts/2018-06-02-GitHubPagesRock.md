title: "GitHub Pages Gameplan: Logging my 100 Days of Code Progress"

Today is round 1, day 3 (R1D3) of the 100 Days of Code challenge I am currently doing, and I think using
a GitHub pages blog to log my progress each day would be a great way to practice using GitHub regularly. 

It would be sweet if I could write a script that took my GitHub pages blog posts and exported them to
the blog on my personal website. I am going to look into that. 

That's the gameplan for now. Look for short daily posts regarding 100 Days of Code coming soon!
